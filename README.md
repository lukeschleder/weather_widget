## Weather Widget

Weather widget is a web application that gets the current weather for any place in the world and allows the user to toggle a 7 day forecast.  Here are some of the tools I used to build it:

- Laravel
- Livewire
- Tailwind CSS
- AlpineJS
- Open Weather API
- Google places autocomplete API

This project was inspired by a video from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com)
